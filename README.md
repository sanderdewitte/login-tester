# Login Tester

This script automates login testing using real user passwords by interacting with the `login` command via `expect`. It is useful for verifying that password hashes written to `/etc/shadow` work as intended.

## üîß Requirements

- Ubuntu or other Linux system with local user accounts
- `expect` installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install expect
  ```

- Must be run as root:
  ```bash
  sudo expect ./test_logins.exp
  ```

## üìù Usage

1. Open `test_logins.exp` and update the `set users` block with the usernames and passwords you want to test:
   ```tcl
   set users {
     {user1 verysecret123}
     {user2 verysecret456}
   }
   ```

2. Run the script as root:
   ```bash
   sudo expect ./test_logins.exp
   ```

3. Output will look like:
   ```
   üîê Testing login for user: user1
   ‚úÖ Login succeeded for user1
   üîê Testing login for user: user2
   ‚ùå Login failed for user2
   ```

> The script suppresses all MOTD, shell banners, and system output. Only test results are shown.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This does **not** change any passwords or system state.
- This is for **local PAM authentication** only. It does not test SSH, LDAP, or other remote login systems.
- Passwords are stored in plain text in the script, so use with care and only for trusted environments.
